# An Interesting Article: The Engineering/Manager Problem

I really liked this article by Charity Majors because it clarifies a major doubt in my head. I constantly hear about how software engineers go into managerial roles to obtain a higher paying job with more responisibilities. This article brings up the point that "Management is not a promotion it is a change of profession". Software engineers that have spent years honing in on their skills in tech actually undergo a transition to a job where they likely have very limited skills and experience. Thus, it is a myth that the enginnering to managerial transition is a promotion.

I also find this article interesting because it highlights how the best managers in this world constantly work on hands on projects (like an engineer would) and the best tech leads have had experience in managing teams. The idea i get from the article is that to be excellent in either role, one must constantly be rotating between each role, much like a Pendulum - and not simultaneously! Because it would be rather foolish to do both at the same time.

Here is a link to the article:
